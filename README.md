Problem Statement.
The topic of this year was: Photo Slideshow.

Roughly speaking: Given <A set of horizontal and vertical pictures> the task was to organise them and create a slideshow, such that the transitions of the slides maximise certain serendipity feeling in the user. Such this serendipity among A and B was measured by 3 forces in tension: What is in A that is not in B; What is in B that is not in A; What is in both. The task forced to keep these 3 forces in equilibrium so as to maximise the points.
